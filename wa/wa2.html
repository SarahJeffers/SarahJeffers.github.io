    <p style="font-family: Arial">I am a fourth year theatre major and CTD minor. In the future, I hope to do freelance design for small companies where I design their logo, website, social media posts, and more. I am already doing this for an upcoming coffee shop in Boulder. Here is the website I made for them: <a href = "https://ruzocoffee.com">ruzocoffee.com</a>. </p>

</header>
<body>
    <p style="font-family: Arial">I have a decent amount of knowledge about how to build websites with platforms like Wix, SquareSpace, Word Press, etc. I learned the basics of coding last semester in Computational Foundations. Now, I am looking forward to combining these skills to better understand how websites work and how to change them from directly within their code.</p>

    <h3 style="font-family: Arial">My Favorite YouTube Video</h3>
</header>
<body>
    <p style="font-family: Arial">My favorite video game is Hollow Knight. My favorite YouTube video is by a creator named Mossbag: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XDiWYFGGqY&t=52s">The (Mostly) Complete Lore of Hollow Knight</a>. The video is a super long, deep dive into the lore of Hollow Knight. It's very funny, and makes me love the video game even more.</p>
