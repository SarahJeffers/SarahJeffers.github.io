    <p>I am a fourth year theatre major and CTD minor. In the future, I hope to do freelance design for small companies where I design their logo, website, social media posts, and more. I am already doing this for an upcoming coffee shop in Boulder. Here is the website I made for them: <a href = "https://ruzocoffee.com">ruzocoffee.com</a>. </p>
